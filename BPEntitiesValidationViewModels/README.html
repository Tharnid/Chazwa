Entity Relational Model

Method for describing Data or Information Needs
Allows you to abstractly describe your needs to faciltate storage
Gives you a core vocab for describing your data needs


Entity Keys

Primary Key - unique identifies the entity
Foreign Key - connects to entities
Natural Key - exists in the real world to identity an entity (Serial Number or SSN)

Attribute Types

Simple (Birthday Last Login)
Composite (address etc)

By Entities we are not talking about EF

    - Design of Entities does not limit where they are stored


View Models

a use case specific view of data for one and two way binding to physical or logical views

** any data passed or used by a view **

!*! Pragmatism - ViewModel for every entity...over engineering match effort with resources !*!

Create them as necessary

Many vm's are not shaped like your domain objects

Separation between entities and vm's can aid in maintenance of large scale projects

    Loosely typed vm's are acceptable if there is a "win" in the schedule is worth the risk
