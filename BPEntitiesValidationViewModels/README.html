Entity Relational Model

Method for describing Data or Information Needs
Allows you to abstractly describe your needs to faciltate storage
Gives you a core vocab for describing your data needs


Entity Keys

Primary Key - unique identifies the entity
Foreign Key - connects to entities
Natural Key - exists in the real world to identity an entity (Serial Number or SSN)

Attribute Types

Simple (Birthday Last Login)
Composite (address etc)

By Entities we are not talking about EF

    - Design of Entities does not limit where they are stored
