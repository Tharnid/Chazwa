LINQ Notes
==========

Extension Methods

-- Static Class...Static method...this keyword...called as an instance

-- method syntax that passes delegates style safe function pointer

Multi Line 
==========

-- single statement does not require a return

foundCustomer = customerList.FirstOrDefault(c =>
{
	Debug.WriteLine(c.LastName);
	return c.CustomerId == customerId; // or whatever
})

Chaining

foundCustomer = customerList.FirstOrDefault(c =>
{
	.Where(c =>
		c.CustomerId == customerId)
	.Skip(1)
	.FirstOrDefault();
})

foundCustomer = query.First(); // as an example

Sorting
=======

OrderBy
OrdByDescending
ThenBy
ThenByDescending
Reverse - reverses the order

(Deferred Execution)

Creating
========

Operators:

	Range 
	Repeat

Enumerable class methods
	NOT extension methods
	NOT Deferred

Comparing and combining
=======================

	Set Operators

		Intersect
		Except
		Concat
		Distinct
		Union

	Extension Methods

Projections
===========

	Select
	SelectMany

	Why?
		Limit to needed props
		Perform an action on the properties
		Morph the sequence into another type

	Projects a Type
		
		OriginalType
		ExistingType
		AnonymousType

Parent/Child Data Scenarios
===========================

	Parent Objects have a list of child related data
		
		-- Shopping cart as an example


	SelectMany

		-- 

Data Binding
============

	Windows Forms

	WPF
		SilverLight (riiight)
		Windows 8
		Windows Phone 8

	DataSource  Property
		
		-- Binds data directly to a control on the user interface

	BindingSource Control

		-- Separate control on the form
		-- Bind each control to the BindingSource
		-- Bind the data to the BindingSource

	Goal

		-- Using the results of a LINQ query for binding
